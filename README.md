# Docker Portus

[![Portus 2.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/portys-2.0.1-green.svg)](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/releases/tag/2.0.1)

This is We ahead's attempt at a dockerized [Portus](http://port.us.org) with
[s6](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/) and SSL.

It requires something in front of it that handles SSL termination, for example
nginx.
